# Exercise 16: Code Challenges

For this exercise you will work on 3 code challenges. The object is not to complete each challenge, but to design the steps necessary to solve the problem (an algorithm). You can do this by using pseudo code.  Pseudocode is a "text-based" algorithmic design tool. In short, pseudocode allows you to write out the steps in your algotithm in plain english. Then you can go back and implement each step.

```js
// Write a function that returns "greater than" if a number in an array is 5 or false if a number is less than 5.

// 1. Loop through the array
// 2. If i is less than or equal to 5 then
// 3. console.log less than or equal
// 4. If i is greater than 5
// 5. console.log "greater than"
```

This is a very simple example, but it shows how we can use pseudo code to create a solution to the, before we start coding.

Pseudocode each solution, then try to solve them. You may use [mdn](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array) and [w3 schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_methods.asp)
