# Exercise 08: More on loops

Let's review some topics from previous lessons.

We use a `for` loop when we know how many time we want to run a loop.

```javascript
for (let i = 0; i <= 10; i++) {
console.log(i);
}

```

A `while` loop is used to evaluate whether an expression is true.

```javascript
let isRequired = true;

while(isRequired) {
    console.log(isRequired)
    isRequired = false;
}

```

```javascript
for (let n = 1; n <= 10; n++){
    if(n % 2 == 0){ // we used the == to compare the values. The single = is used to assign a value
        console.log(n)
    }
}
```

How would we change the code above to log common multiples of 2 and 5?

Try changing the condition to say `n <= 100`. What will the output be?

How would we change the code to log either multiples of 2 or 5?

## Practice exercises

Your objective is to construct a loop to solve each scenario.

You are going on a trip and need fuel up. Your vehicle has a 12 gallon tank. Write a loop that logs a message when the tank is full.

```javascript
var fuelLevel = 0;

while(fuelLevel < 12) {
    fuelLevel += 1;
}
console.log(fuelLevel + " gallons is enough to begin your trip");
```

Create a loop that will log a warning message when you down to a quarter tank of gas. Let's assume that we start with a full tank at 12 gallons.

Create a loop that will tell you how many gallons are required for your trip. Let's assume that your vehicle gets 22 miles per gallon, and the trip is 100 miles.

Create 2 other scenarios and creat a loop to solve them.

Now let's go through methods and when to use them.

```javascript
/**
 * login.page.js
 * 
     * a method to encapsule automation code to interact with the page
     * e.g. to login using username and password
     */
    async login (username, password) {
        await this.inputUsername.setValue(username);
        await this.inputPassword.setValue(password);
        await this.btnSubmit.click();
    }

```

When we first initialize Webdriver, we are given the example above in our `login.page.js` file. The example method `login` takes two parameters, `username` and `password`, and runs a set of instructions. It first sets the value of `username` to the `inputUsername` element. Second, it sets the value of `password` to the `inputPassword` element. Finally, it clicks the submit button. This entire method will run whenever the user calls the `login` method, along with the corresponding parameters.

```javascript
describe('My Login application', () => {
    it('should login with valid credentials', async () => {
        await LoginPage.open();

        await LoginPage.login('tomsmith', 'SuperSecretPassword!');
        await expect(SecurePage.flashAlert).toBeExisting();
        await expect(SecurePage.flashAlert).toHaveTextContaining(
            'You logged into a secure area!');
    });
```

Now you give it a try. Create a method that runs a set of instructions when called. Use any one of the pages on [http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/](http://the-internet.herokuapp.com/).
